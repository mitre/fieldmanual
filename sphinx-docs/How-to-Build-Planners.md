# How to Build Planners

For any desired planner decision logic not encapsulated in the default _batch_ planner (or any other existing planner), CALDERA requires that a new planner be implemented to encode such decision logic.

## Buckets

The cornerstone of how planners make decisions is centered on a concept we call 'buckets'. Buckets denote the planner's state machine and are intended to correspond to _buckets_ of CALDERA abilities. Within a planner, macro level decision control is encoded by specifying which buckets (i.e. states) follow other buckets, thus forming a bucket state machine. Micro level decisions are made within the buckets, by specifying any logic detailing which abilities to send to agents and when to do so.

CALDERA abilities are also tagged by the buckets they are in. By default, when abilities are loaded by CALDERA, they are tagged with the bucket of the ATT&CK technique they belong to. CALDERA abilities can also be tagged/untagged at will by any planner as well, before starting the operation or at any point in it. The intent is for buckets to work with the abilities that have been tagged for that bucket, but this is by no means enforced.

## Creating a Planner

Let's dive into creating a planner to see the power and flexibility of the CALDERA planner component. For this example, we will implement a planner that will carry out the following state machine:

![privileged persistence sm screenshot](img/privileged_persistence_state_machine.png)

The planner will consist of 5 buckets:  _Privilege Escalation_, _Collection_, _Persistence_, _Discovery_, and _Lateral Movement_. As implied by the state machine, this planner will use the underlying adversary abilities to attempt to spread to as many hosts as possible and establish persistence. As an additional feature, if an agent cannot obtain persistence due to unsuccessful privilege escalation attempts, then the agent will execute collection abilities immediately in case it loses access to the host.

This document will walk through creating three basic components of a planner module (initialization, entrypoint method, and bucket methods), creating the planner data object, and applying the planner to a new operation.  

### Creating the Python Module 

We will create a python module called `privileged_persistence.py` and nest it under `app/` in the `mitre/stockpile` plugin at `plugins/stockpile/app/privileged_persistence.py`. 

**_First, lets build the static initialization of the planner:_**

```python
class LogicalPlanner:

    def __init__(self, operation, planning_svc, stopping_conditions=()):
        self.operation = operation
        self.planning_svc = planning_svc
        self.stopping_conditions = stopping_conditions
        self.stopping_condition_met = False
        self.state_machine = ['privilege_escalation', 'persistence', 'collection', 'discovery', 'lateral_movement']
        self.next_bucket = 'privilege_escalation'
```

Look closer at these lines:

```python
    def __init__(self, operation, planning_svc, stopping_conditions=()):
        self.operation = operation
        self.planning_svc = planning_svc
        self.stopping_conditions = stopping_conditions
        self.stopping_condition_met = False
```

The `__init__()` method for a planner must take and store the required arguments for the `operation` instance, `planning_svc` handle, and any supplied `stopping_conditions`.
 
Additionally, `self.stopping_condition_met`, which is used to control when to stop bucket execution, is initially set to `False`. During bucket execution, this property will be set to `True` if any facts gathered by the operation exactly match (both name and value) any of the facts provided in `stopping_conditions`. When this occurs, the operation will stop running new abilities.

```python
        self.state_machine = ['privilege_escalation', 'persistence', 'collection', 'discovery', 'lateral_movement']
```

The `self.state_machine` variable is an optional list enumerating the base line order of the planner state machine. This ordered list **_does not_** control the bucket execution order, but is used to define a base line state machine that we can refer back to in our decision logic. This will be demonstrated in our example below when we create the bucket methods.

```python
        self.next_bucket = 'privilege_escalation'
```

The `self.next_bucket` variable holds the next bucket to be executed. This is the next bucket that the planner will enter and whose bucket method will next control the planning logic. Initially, we set `self.next_bucket` to the first bucket the planner will begin in. We will modify `self.next_bucket` from within our bucket methods in order to specify the next bucket to execute.

_Additional Planner class variables_

It is also important to note that a planner may define any required variables that it may need. For instance, many custom planners require information to be passed from one bucket to another during execution. This can be done by creating class variables to store information which can be accessed within any bucket method and will persist between bucket transitions.

**_Now, lets the define the planner's entrypoint method: `execute`_**

```python
    async def execute(self):
        await self.planning_svc.execute_planner(self)
```

`execute` is where the planner starts and where any runtime initialization is done. `execute_planner` works by executing the bucket specified by `self.next_bucket` until the `self.stopping_condition_met` variable is set to True. For our planner, no further runtime initialization is required in the `execute` method.

**_Finally, lets create our bucket methods:_**

```python
    async def privilege_escalation(self):
        ability_links = await self.planning_svc.get_links(self.operation, buckets=['privilege escalation'])
        paw = ability_links[0].paw if ability_links else None
        link_ids = [await self.operation.apply(l) for l in ability_links]
        await self.operation.wait_for_links_completion(link_ids)
        successful = self.operation.has_fact('{}.privilege.root'.format(paw), True) or self.operation.has_fact('{}.privilege.admin'.format(paw), True)
        if successful:
            self.next_bucket = 'persistence'
        else:
            self.next_bucket = 'collection'

    async def persistence(self):
        await self.planning_svc.exhaust_bucket(self, 'persistence', self.operation)
        self.next_bucket = await self.planning_svc.default_next_bucket('persistence', self.state_machine)

    async def collection(self):
        await self.planning_svc.exhaust_bucket(self, 'collection', self.operation)
        self.next_bucket = 'discovery'

    async def discovery(self):
        await self.planning_svc.exhaust_bucket(self, 'discovery', self.operation)
        lateral_movement_unlocked = bool(len(await self.planning_svc.get_links(self.operation, buckets=['lateral_movement'])))
        if lateral_movement_unlocked:
            self.next_bucket = await self.planning_svc.default_next_bucket('discovery', self.state_machine)
        else:
            # planner will transtion from this bucket to being done
            self.next_bucket = None

    async def lateral_movement(self):
        await self.planning_svc.exhaust_bucket(self, 'lateral_movement', self.operation)
        self.next_bucket = 'privilege_escalation'
```

These bucket methods are where all inter-bucket transitions and intra-bucket logic will be encoded. For every bucket in our planner state machine, we must define a corresponding bucket method.

Lets look at each of the bucket methods in detail:

* `privilege_escalation()` - We first use `get_links` planning service utility to retrieve all abilities (links) tagged as _privilege escalation_ from the operation adversary. We then push these links to the agent with `apply` and wait for these links to complete with `wait_for_links_completion()`, both from the operation utility. After the links complete, we check for the creation of custom facts that indicate the privilege escalation was successful (Note: this assumes the privilege escalation abilities we are using create custom facts in the format "{paw}.privilege.root" or "{paw}.privilege.admin" with values of `True` or `False`). If privilege escalation was successful, set the next bucket to be executed to _persistence_, otherwise _collection_.
* `persistence()`, `collection()`, `lateral_movement()` - These buckets have no complex logic, we just want to execute all links available and are tagged for the given bucket. We can use the `exhaust_bucket()` planning service utility to apply all links for the given bucket tag. Before exiting, we set the next bucket as desired. Note that in the `persistence()` bucket we use the `default_next_bucket()` planning service utility, which will automatically choose the next bucket after "persistence" in the provided `self.state_machine` ordered list.
* `discovery()` - This bucket starts by running all _discovery_ ability links available. Then we utilize a useful trick to determine if the planner should proceed to the _lateral movement_ bucket. We use `get_links()` to determine if the _discovery_ links that were just executed ended up unlocking ability links for _lateral movement_. From there we set the next bucket accordingly.

**_Additional Notes on Privileged Persistence Planner_**

- You may have noticed that the _privileged_persistence_ planner is only notionally more sophisticated than running certain default adversary profiles. This is correct. If you can find or create an adversary profile whose ability enumeration (i.e. order) can carry out your desired operational progression between abilities and can be executed in batch (by the default _batch_ planner) or in a sequentially atomic order (by _atmomic_ planner), it is advised to go that route. However, any decision logic above those simple planners will have to be implemented in a new planner.
- The _privileged persistence_ planner did not have explicit logic to handle multiple agents. We just assumed the planner buckets would only have to handle a single active agent given the available ability links returned from the planning service. 

### Creating the Planner Object

In order to use this planner inside CALDERA, we will create the following YAML file at `plugins/stockpile/data/planners/80efdb6c-bb82-4f16-92ae-6f9d855bfb0e.yml`:

```yaml
---

id: 80efdb6c-bb82-4f16-92ae-6f9d855bfb0e
name: privileged_persistence
description: |
  Privileged Persistence Planner: Attempt to spread to as many hosts as possible and establish persistence.
  If privilege escalation attempts succeed, establish persistence. Then, collect data.
module: plugins.stockpile.app.privileged_persistence
params: {}
ignore_enforcement_modules: []
```

This will create a planner in CALDERA which will call the module we've created at `plugins.stockpile.app.privileged_persistence`.

*NOTE: For planners intended to be used with profiles containing repeatable abilities, `allow_repeatable_abilities: True` must be added to the planner YAML file. Otherwise, CALDERA will default the value to `False` and assume the planner does not support repeatable abilities.* 

### Using the Planner

To use the planner, create an Operation and select the "Use privileged_persistence planner" option in the planner dropdown (under Autonomous). Any selected planner will use the abilities in the selected adversary profile during the operation. Since abilities are automatically added to buckets which correlate to MITRE ATT&CK tactics, any abilities with the following tactics will be executed by the privileged_persistence planner: _privilege_escalation_, _persistence_, _collection_, _discovery_, and _lateral_movement_.

## A Minimal Planner

Custom planners do not have to use the buckets approach to work with the CALDERA operation interface if not desired. Here is a minimal planner that will still work with the operation interface.

```python

class LogicalPlanner:

    def __init__(self, operation, planning_svc, stopping_conditions=()):
        self.operation = operation
        self.planning_svc = planning_svc
        self.stopping_conditions = stopping_conditions
        self.stopping_condition_met = False

    async def execute(self):
        #
        # Implement Planner Logic
        #
        return
```

## Advanced Fact Usage

In addition to the basic (name, value) information present in facts and documented in [Basic Usage](Basic-Usage.html#facts), there are some additional fields that may prove useful when developing and working with planners.

#### Fact Origins

As of Caldera v4.0, facts now have the new `origin_type` and `source` fields, which identify how Caldera learned that fact. There are 5 possible values for the `origin_type` field:
* DOMAIN - This fact originates from Caldera's general knowledge about environments
* SEEDED - This fact originates from a source file, which was used to seed an operation
* LEARNED - This fact originates from an operation, which uncovered it
* IMPORTED - This fact originates from a previous operation, or another pre-existing fact collection
* USER - This fact originates from a User, i.e. was entered through the GUI

The `source` field, on the other hand, contains a UUID4 that corresponds to the originating object described by `origin_type`.

#### Fact Links/Relationships

As of Caldera v4.0, facts also now have new fields in them that track the Links and Relationships that have contributed to that fact in some way, accessible as `links` and `relationships` respectively. Each of these properties is a list of corresponding objects, with `links` corresponding to all Link objects that generated/identified this Fact, and `relationships` corresponding to all Relationship objects that reference this Fact.

#### Fact Score

One potentially useful Fact property for planners is the `score` property. This tracks how many times a fact has been used successfully in links, allowing facts to have an inherent 'weight' to them when they are useful. Facts start with a score of 1, a value that typically increases by 1 every time a link uses it (though scores can be increased or decreased by varying amounts by other means). For context, a link's score, when generated by Caldera's core planning services, is simply the sum of the scores of the facts utilized by that link.


## Planning Service Utilities

Within a planner, these utilities are available from `self.planning_svc`:

* `exhaust_bucket()` - Apply all links for specified bucket. Blocks execution until all links are completed, either after batch push, or separately for every pushed link. Allows a single agent to be specified.
* `execute_links()` - Wait for links to complete and update stopping conditions.
* `default_next_bucket()` - Returns next bucket as specified in the given state machine. If the current bucket is the last in the list, the bucket order loops from last bucket to first. Used in the above example to advance to the next bucket in the persistence and discovery buckets.
* `add_ability_to_next_bucket()` - Applies a custom bucket to an ability. This can be used to organize abilities into buckets that aren't standard MITRE ATT&CK tactics.
* `execute_planner()` - Executes the default planner execution flow, progressing from bucket to bucket. Execution will stop if: all buckets have been executed (`self.next_bucket` is set to `None`), planner stopping conditions have been met, or the operation is halted.
* `get_links()` - For an operation and agent combination, create links (that can be executed). When no agent is supplied, links for all agents in an operation are returned. Uses `operation.all_facts()` to determine if an ability has been unlocked. Used in the above example in the discovery bucket to determine if any lateral movement abilities have been unlocked.
* `get_cleanup_links()` - Generates cleanup links for a given operation, to be run when a operation is completed.
* `generate_and_trim_links()` - Creates new links based on provided operation, agent, and abilities. Optionally, trim links using `trim_links()` to return only valid links with completed facts. Facts are selected from the operation using `operation.all_facts()`.
* `check_stopping_conditions()` - Checks the collected operation facts against the stopping conditions set by the planner.
* `update_stopping_condition_met()` - Update a planner's `stopping_condition_met` property with the results of `check_stopping_conditions()`. 


## Operation Utilities

Within a planner, all public utilities are available from `self.operation`. The following may assist in planner development:

* `apply()` - Add a link to the operation.
* `wait_for_links_completion()` - Wait for started links to be completed.
* `all_facts()` - Return a list of all facts collected during an operation. These will include both learned and seeded (from the operation source) facts.
* `has_fact()` - Search an operation for a fact with a particular name and value.
* `all_relationships()` - Return a list of all relationships collected during an operation.
* `active_agents()` - Find all agents in the operation that have been active since operation start.

## Knowledge Service

As of Caldera V4.0, a new service has been added to the core of Caldera for use with planners and other components that make use of facts: the Knowledge Service. This service allows the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of facts, relationships, and rules.
Typically, users should not need to interact with this service directly, as common usage patterns are already baked into core objects such as `Link`, `Agent`, and `Operation`, but the service can be accessed by using `BaseService.get_service('knowledge_svc')`, should the need arise for more complex interactions with the available data.
The Knowledge Service stores data persistently in the same manner that Caldera's internal Data Service does (by writing it to a file on shutdown), and can be cleared in much the same way if necessary (by using the `--fresh` argument on the server).

The following methods are available from the Knowledge Service:
```python
app.objects.secondclass.c_fact
```
* `KnowledgeService.add_fact(fact)` - Add a fact to the Knowledge Service's datastore. The `fact` argument must be an already instantiated `Fact()` object.
* `KnowledgeService.delete_fact(criteria)` - Remove matching facts from the datastore. The `criteria` argument should be a dictionary with fields to match existing facts against for selection.
* `KnowledgeService.get_facts(criteria)` - Retrieve matching facts from the datastore. The `criteria` argument should be a dictionary with fields to match existing facts against for selection.
* `KnowledgeService.update_fact(criteria, updates)` - Update an existing fact in the datastore. The `criteria` argument should be a dictionary with fields to match existing facts against for selection, and `updates` should be a dictionary with fields to change and their new values.
* `KnowledgeService.get_fact_origin(fact)` - Identifies the location/source of a provided fact. The `fact` argument can be either a name to search for or a full blown Fact object. The return is a tuple of the ID corresponding to the origin object for this fact, and the type of origin object.

```python 
app.objects.secondclass.c_relationship
```
* `KnowledgeService.add_relationship(relationship)` - Add a relationship to the datastore. The `relationship` argument must be an already instantiated `Relationship()` object.
* `KnowledgeService.delete_relationship(criteria)` - Remove a relationship from the datastore. The `criteria` argument should be a dictionary containing fields to match relationships against.
* `KnowledgeService.get_relationships(criteria)` - Retrieve a relationship from the datastore. The `criteria` argument should be a dictionary containing fields to match relationships against, and can contain further dictionaries to match facts in relationships against.
* `KnowledgeService.update_relationship(criteria, updates)` - Update an existing relationship in the datastore. The `criteria` argument should be a dictionary containing files to match relationships and their component facts against, while the `updates` argument should be dictionary of similar form, containing the values to update.

```python
app.objects.secondclass.c_rule
```
* `KnowledgeService.add_rule(rule)` - Add a rule to the datastore. The `rule` argument must be an already existing `Rule()` object.
* `KnowledgeService.delete_rule(criteria)` - Remove a rule from the datastore. The `criteria` argument should be a dictionary containing fields and values to match existing rules against.
* `KnowledgeService.get_rules(criteria)` - Retrieve matching rules from the datastore. The `criteria` argument should be a dictionary containing files to match existing rules against.

All objects added to the Knowledge service are checked against existing objects in order to enforce de-duplication, with one caveat. As origin is tracked for facts generated by links in the current implementation, this means duplicate facts created during different operations can exist in the fact store simultaneously. Facts/Relationships are usually automatically added to the fact store by `Link` objects as part of the process of parsing output, though they can be added manually should the need arise.
